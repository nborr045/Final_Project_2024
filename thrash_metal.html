        <h2>How It Came to Be</h2>

    </div>
        <p>In response to the rise of heavy metal's subgenre of glam metal, thrash metal emerged. Glam metal was commercialized, mainstream, and radio-friendly, while thrash metal was raw, underground, and completely rebellious. The name comes from the way people would thrash around in mosh pits. The 'Big 4' are considered Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, as they were the first four thrash metal bands to sign with a record label. They are also considered a staple for any metal fan.</p>

    </div>
        <p>In this genre, people would usually wear jeans and have long hair. The staple of the genre was jean vests filled with patches. People would sew or iron patches of their favorite bands all around the vest. The vests often had a large patch on the back that signified the wearer's favorite band.</p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <div class="thrash_pic">
        <img src="images/thrash-rivalry.jpg" alt="Megadeth lead singer, Dave Mustaine, singing and Metallica's lead singer, James Hetfield, singing.">
    </div>
        <p>Two of the 'Big 4' bands actually began due to a rivalry. Megadeth's lead singer, Dave Mustaine, was once part of Metallica's original lineup as the lead guitarist. He wrote most of the riffs and is responsible for some of the band's most famous tracks, such as those on the album Master of Puppets. Despite this, he had a bad personality when drunk, and at the time, Metallica drank very often. Because of this, Dave Mustaine was kicked out of Metallica and replaced with an ex-member of the band Exodus. As a form of revenge, Dave Mustaine formed his own band, Megadeth, and sometimes used the same riffs he created for Metallica in different songs. Although this rivalry between the bands and their fans lasted for years, the bands are now reconciled and recognize that they were both important for the history of metal.</p>
