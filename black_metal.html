    <h2>How It Came to Be</h2>
    <div class="bm_pic">
    <img src="images/venom-band.jpeg" alt="Band 'Venom' pose for a picture.">
</div>
    <p>In the surge of metal, a band called 'Venom' was the first band to ever unapologetically plaster Satan's face on their album cover,also their second album 'Black Metal' brought the name of the genre. By doing this, people were riled up and saw it as controversial, beginning the first wave of Black Metal. A lot of this genre's theme focuses on Satan, Hell, and Satanist practices. The sound of the first wave was not solidified until the band 'Bathory' released their secon album 'The Return...' which was dark, moody, and with scratchy vocals.</p>
    <p>The Second Wave of this genre started as a result of 'Death Metal'. In the genre of Death Metal, members would look pretty average while having deep growling vocals and lyrics related to gore. Black Metal decided instead they wanted to look different while still sounding heavy. Bands such as 'Burzum' took inspiration from Bathory's intial sound and made the vocals scratchier. The quality in this wave got consequently worse on purpose as this genre was meant to be done 'cheaply' and was made to sound like someone basically recorded it from their basement in their phone. The wave truly became popular in Norway thanks to bands such as Mayhem, Burzum, Immortal, etc.</p>

</div>
    <p>In the first wave, people usually just wore spikes and black clothing with metal bands. When the second wave began though, coprse paint became the norm in the scene and extremely spikey bracelets were common.</p>

    <h2>Fun Facts?</h2>

    <img src="images/mayhem.jpeg" alt="Mayhem band members pose for a picture.">
</div>
    <p>Mayhem is one of the most infamous bands of the Second Wave of Black Metal not only for their unfluence but also because of their story. To begin with, they caught attention already since they used to do rituals on stage and cut themselves at concerts. The lead singer Per Yngve called himself 'Dead'. This is due to an incident in his childhood in which bullies ruptured his spleen and he had a near-death experience. Ever since then, he developed Cotard's syndrome and believed he had already died. Essentially, believing he was a walking corpse he would bury his clothes in the ground to smell more dead and would carry a dead bird with him at all times. Eventually, Dead killed himself through a shotgun wound to the head. Nirvana's lead singer Kurt Cobain would take inspiration from this band later on. The guitarist of the band 'Euronymous' found 'Dead' dead after killing himself and he decided to take a picture, making it the album cover of their next album 'Dawn of the Black Hearts'. After the police cleaned up the scene, there was still some brain and pieces of skull left over, which Euronymous made a stew out of. Euronymous after all this for some reason was planning to kidnap former guitarist of Mayhen and member of Burzum 'Varg' to make a Snuff film. Upon Varg finding out about Euronymous' plans, Varg stabbed Euronymous in the skull and killed him, which led him to go to jail. He is nowadays out of jail and makes Youtube videos under the name 'Varg Vikernes' and is a book author.</p>
