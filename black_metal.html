    <h2>How It Came to Be</h2>
    <div class="bm_pic">
    <img src="images/venom-band.jpeg" alt="Band 'Venom' pose for a picture.">
</div>
    <p>In the surge of metal, a band called Venom was the first to unapologetically feature Satan's face on their album cover. Their second album, Black Metal, also helped bring the name of the genre into the spotlight. By doing this, people were riled up and saw it as controversial, marking the beginning of the first wave of black metal. Much of this genre's theme focuses on Satan, Hell, and Satanist practices. The sound of the first wave was not solidified until the band Bathory released their second album, The Return..., which was dark, moody, and featured scratchy vocals.</p>
    <p>The second wave of this genre started as a result of death metal. In death metal, members would often look pretty average, while having deep growling vocals and lyrics related to gore. Black metal, however, decided they wanted to look different while still sounding heavy. Bands such as Burzum took inspiration from Bathory's initial sound and made the vocals even scratchier. The quality in this wave intentionally worsened, as the genre was meant to be done "cheaply" and was made to sound like it was recorded in someone's basement on a phone. The wave truly became popular in Norway, thanks to bands such as Mayhem, Burzum, and Immortal.</p>

</div>
    <p>In the first wave, people usually just wore spikes and black clothing with metal band logos. However, when the second wave began, corpse paint became the norm in the scene, and extremely spiky bracelets became common.</p>

    <h2>Fun Facts?</h2>
    <div class="bm_pic">
    <img src="images/mayhem.jpeg" alt="Mayhem band members pose for a picture.">
</div>
    <p>Mayhem is one of the most infamous bands of the second wave of black metal, not only for their influence but also because of their shocking story. They first gained attention for performing rituals on stage and cutting themselves at concerts. The lead singer, Per Yngve, called himself 'Dead.' This name stemmed from an incident in his childhood in which bullies ruptured his spleen, and he had a near-death experience. After that, he developed Cotard's syndrome and believed he had already died. Essentially, believing he was a walking corpse, he would bury his clothes in the ground to smell more dead and would carry a dead bird with him at all times. Eventually, Dead took his own life by shooting himself in the head with a shotgun. Nirvana's lead singer, Kurt Cobain, later took inspiration from this band. The band's guitarist, Euronymous, discovered Dead's body after he killed himself and decided to take a photo, which became the album cover of their next album, Dawn of the Black Hearts. After the police cleaned up the scene, remnants of Dead's brain and skull remained, and Euronymous made a stew out of them. Following all of this, for some reason, Euronymous was planning to kidnap former Mayhem guitarist and Burzum member Varg to make a snuff film. When Varg found out about Euronymous' plans, he stabbed Euronymous in the skull, killing him, which led Varg to be imprisoned. He is now out of jail and makes YouTube videos under the name 'Varg Vikernes' and is also a book author.</p>
